Keep Your Fleet Moving. Eliminate Costly Roadside Failures.
Subheadline
When every vehicle off the road costs hundreds per hour in lost revenue and customer dissatisfaction, hydraulic and fuel line protection isn’t optional—it’s essential fleet management.

The Challenge Section
The Hidden Costs of Fleet Hose Failures
Every fleet manager knows the nightmare: A driver calls from the roadside with a hydraulic leak. What follows is a cascade of costs:
💸 Direct Costs:
$500-$2,000 emergency roadside service
$200-$800 replacement hose and fittings
$150-$500 towing to repair facility
4-8 hours skilled technician labor
📉 Indirect Costs:
Missed deliveries and customer penalties
Driver downtime wages
Expedited parts shipping
Damage to customer relationships
Safety violations and potential fines
Total Impact: $5,000-$15,000+ per incident for a single vehicle failure
The Industry Reality:
Average fleet experiences 3-5 preventable hose failures per vehicle annually
Unprotected hoses fail 3-5x faster in constant vibration environments
Brake line failures create immediate safety hazards and regulatory violations
Fuel line damage causes fire risks and environmental contamination

Industry-Specific Pain Points
What Fleet Managers Face Daily:
🚨 Constant Vibration Damage
 Highway miles, rough roads, and 24/7 operations create relentless wear on unprotected lines rubbing against frames, brackets, and adjacent components.
❄️ Extreme Weather Exposure
 From -20°F winter operations to 120°F summer heat, temperature cycling degrades unprotected rubber hoses exponentially faster.
⚡ Multiple Failure Points
 Each vehicle has dozens of vulnerable lines: hydraulic brakes, air brake systems, fuel delivery, DEF lines, battery cables, transmission coolers.
📋 Regulatory Pressure
 DOT inspections, safety compliance, and environmental regulations mean any leak or damage can sideline vehicles immediately.
💼 Budget Constraints
 Maintenance departments must maximize uptime while controlling costs—making preventative solutions that work essential.

The EPHA Solution
Protection Engineered for Fleet Operations
EPHA Hose Protectors deliver exactly what fleet maintenance demands: fast installation, proven durability, measurable ROI.
✓ Install Without Vehicle Downtime
 4-step installation takes 5 minutes per location—no lift time required, no vehicle disassembly. Apply during routine service intervals.
✓ Withstand Highway Conditions
 Proprietary material handles constant vibration, temperature extremes (-40°F to 430°F), and chemical exposure from road salt, diesel, hydraulic fluids.
✓ Protect Critical Safety Systems
 Guard brake lines, air brake assemblies, ABS sensors, and fuel systems against the failures that trigger DOT violations.
✓ High-Visibility Options
 Orange and yellow colors make inspections easier and demonstrate proactive maintenance to regulators.
✓ Scale Across Fleet
 Standardized protection program across all vehicles reduces inventory complexity and training requirements.

Fleet Applications
Where Fleet Managers Deploy EPHA Protection:
🚛 Hydraulic Brake Systems
 Protect master cylinder lines, wheel cylinder assemblies, and ABS connections from frame contact and road debris.
 Recommended: HP5, HP6 (Black or Hi-Vis Yellow)
💨 Air Brake Lines
 Shield pneumatic lines running along chassis rails from vibration damage and weather exposure.
 Recommended: HP6, HP8 (Hi-Vis Orange)
⛽ Fuel System Protection
 Guard fuel lines, DEF (diesel exhaust fluid) lines, and return lines from abrasion at tank mounting points.
 Recommended: HP5, HP6 (Black)
🔋 Battery Cable Guards
 Prevent shorts and fire hazards from battery cable chafing against metal chassis components.
 Recommended: HP4, HP5 (Black or Hi-Vis Yellow)
📦 Multi-Line Bundle Wraps
 Consolidate and protect multiple lines running together along frame rails and crossmembers.
 Recommended: HP10, HP12 (Black or Hi-Vis Orange)
🔄 Transmission Cooler Lines
 Protect vulnerable cooler lines from road debris impact and vibration wear.
 Recommended: HP6, HP8 (Black)

Case Study
Regional Trucking Company: 85% Downtime Reduction
Company Profile:
 200-vehicle long-haul fleet, 150,000 miles average per vehicle annually
Challenge:
 Experiencing 4-5 hydraulic brake line failures per vehicle per year, costing $180,000+ annually in repairs, downtime, and missed deliveries.
Solution:
 Implemented EPHA protection program during annual PM service:
HP5/HP6 on brake system wear points
HP8 on air brake line chassis contact areas
HP4 on battery cable protection
Results After 12 Months:
85% reduction in brake line failures (4.5 → 0.7 per vehicle)
$156,000 savings in repair and downtime costs
Zero DOT violations for brake system leaks
$15,000 investment in protection paid back in 35 days
“The math is simple. A $6 protector prevents a $2,000 failure. We’ve standardized EPHA across the entire fleet.”
