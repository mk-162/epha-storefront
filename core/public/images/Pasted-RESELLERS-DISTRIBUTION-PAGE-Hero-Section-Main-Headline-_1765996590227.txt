💬 Staff Selling Tips:

Conversation Starters:

"Getting hoses for a repair? These protectors prevent the next failure."
"Noticed you're picking up hydraulic lines—want to protect them this time?"
"For $6 each, these prevent $2,000 hose failures. Most guys grab 4-6."
Objection Handlers:

"I'll think about it" → "They're $6 now versus $2,000 later. Here's a card with the info."
"Never heard of them" → "That's why they keep failing. This is what pro fleets use."
"How many do I need?" → "Most equipment has 6-10 wear points. Let me show you."
🔄 Inventory Management:

Reorder Triggers:

Restock when down to 8-10 units (don't let display look empty)
Order before completely out (empty displays don't sell)
Track which sizes move fastest at your location
Reorder Process:

Simple phone/email reorder: "Refill my counter display"
